# Question 1. Working with Customer Data with Health Insurance ---------------

# Read the data file, custdata_rev.csv, 
# as the data.frame object with the name, 
# health_cust:

health_cust <- read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/custdata_rev.csv')

# Variable Description for health_cust ---------------------------------------

# The following describes the variables 
# in the `health_cust` data.frame.

# custid: ID of customer
# sex: Sex
# is_employed: Employment status
  # NA: Unknown or not applicable
  # TRUE: Employed
  # FALSE: Unemployed
# income: Income (in $)
# marital_status: Marital status
# housing_type: Housing type
# recent_move: 
  # TRUE: Recently moved
  # FALSE: Not recently moved
# age: Age
# state_of_res: State of residence
# gas_usage: Gas usage
  # NA: Unknown or not applicable
  # 001: Included in rent or condo fee
  # 002: Included in electricity payment
  # 003: No charge or gas not used
  # 004-999: $4 to $999 (rounded and top-coded)
# health_ins: Health insuarance status
  # TRUE: customer with health insuarance 
  # FALSE: customer without health insuarance 


# Q1a --------------------------------------------------------------
# Report summary statistics including a mean value 
# for each logical variable in health_cust.

# Answer for Q1a

summary(health_cust$income)
# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
# -6900   10700   26200   41764   51700 1257000 

summary(health_cust$num_vehicles)
# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
# 0.000   1.000   2.000   2.066   3.000   6.000    1720 

summary(health_cust$age)
# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
# 0.00   34.00   48.00   49.16   62.00  120.00

summary(health_cust$gas_usage)
# Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
# 1.00    3.00   10.00   41.17   60.00  570.00    1720



# Q1b --------------------------------------------------------------
# Use `health_cust` data.frame to create a new data.frame, `health_cust2`,
# in which 
# (1) `age` is greater than 0 and less than 100; and
# (2) `income` is positive.

# Answer for Q1b

health_cust2 <- health_cust %>%
  filter(age > 0, age < 100, income > 0)



# Q1c --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the distribution of `income`.

# Answer for Q1c

ggplot(data = health_cust) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = income, alpha = .3))

# the distribution of income is right skewed

# Q1d --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the distribution of `marital_status`.

# Answer for Q1d

ggplot(data = health_cust) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = marital_status))

# most of the people are married 

# Load the ggplot2 package if it's not already loaded
# install.packages("ggplot2")

library(ggplot2)

# Create a bar chart of the marital_status distribution

# Did it in question above

# Q1e --------------------------------------------------------------
# Suppose you randomly pick one customer's observation 
# from each state in data.frame `health_cust`.

# Use ggplot code to find:
# (1) in which state a customer is most likely to have a health insurance; and
# (2) in which state a customer is least likely to have a health insurance.

# Answer for Q1e

ggplot(data = health_cust) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = state, health_ins = "TRUE"))



# Q1f --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the relationship between `age` and `income`.

# Answer for Q1f

ggplot(data = health_cust) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = age, y = income))

# The age and income has a positive correlation until about age 55, 
# then it has a negative correlation. It is a parabola-like figure. 


# Q1g --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the relationship between `age` and `health_ins`.

# Answer for Q1g

ggplot(data = health_cust) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = age, x = health_ins))

# Average age of people who don't have health insurance is around 50.
# The average age of people who do have health insurance is around 38.

# Q1h --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the relationship between `marital_status` and `health_ins`.

# Answer for Q1h

ggplot(health_cust, aes(x = marital_status, fill = health_ins)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

# If you are never married it is more likely that you have health insurance

# Q1i --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide ggplot code and comments to describe 
# the relationship between `marital_status` and `housing_type`.

# Answer for Qi

ggplot(health_cust, aes(x = marital_status, fill = housing_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

# If a person is never married or divorced/separated it is more likely that 
# they rented a place. If a person is married or widowed, it is more likely 
# that they are a homeowner of some sort.
