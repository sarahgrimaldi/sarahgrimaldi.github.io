# Introduction

About this project :clap:

```{r}
1 + 1
```


# Data

The data.frame `starwars` contains the characters from starwars including their name, height, mass, hair color, skin color, eye color, birth year, and sex. 



## Summary of Starwars

This is a summary of starwars

```{r}
skim(starwars) %>% 
  select(-n_missing)
```
This shows the name of the data set, the number of rows, number of columns, and the number of characters



## Starwars Characters height vs mass

```{r}
mpg <- ggplot2::mpg
```

The following line/dot plot shows the height vs mass of Starwars characters including their gender. 

```{r messages=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, label = fig-starwars, fig.cap= "Relationship between height and mass of starwars characters"}

starwars %>%
  filter(mass<100) %>%
  ggplot (aes(mass,height)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = .5,
             aes(color = gender))+
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title = "Height vs Mass of Starwars characters", 
       x = "Mass", 
       y = "Height", 
       color = "Gender")

```


## Distribution of weight bewtween each species

This is a box plot that shows the distribution of weight between each species

```{r}
starwars_species <- starwars %>% subset(species == "Human" | species == "Droid" | species == "Ewok")
# plot the distributions
a <- ggplot(starwars_species, aes(species, mass))
a + geom_boxplot()
```
Ewoks have a much lower mass than either droids or humans, but there is only a single Ewok observation, so I canâ€™t really compare the distribution of masses among these species.

## Summary of each starwars characters
This is a summary of each star wars character

```{r}
#| results: asis
#| echo: false
rmarkdown::paged_table(starwars) 
```
