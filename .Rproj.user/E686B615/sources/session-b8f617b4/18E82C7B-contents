# Question 1. Working with NYC Restaurant Inspection Data ---------------

# Read the data file, custdata_rev.csv, 
# as the data.frame object with the name, 
# restaurant:

restaurant <- read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/DOHMH_NYC_Restaurant_Inspection.csv'
)

# Variable Description for restaurant ---------------------------------------

# The following describes the variables 
# in the `restaurant` data.frame.

# `CAMIS`:
#   -   This is an unique identifier for the entity (restaurant);
#   -   10-digit integer
# `DBA`:
#   -   This field represents the name (doing business as) of the entity (restaurant);
#   -   Public business name, may change at discretion of restaurant owner
# `BORO`:
#   -   Borough in which the entity (restaurant) is located.;
#   -   • `1` = MANHATTAN
#   -   • `2` = BRONX
#   -   • `3` = BROOKLYN
#   -   • `4` = QUEENS
#   -   • `5` = STATEN ISLAND
#   -   • `0` = Missing;
# `CUISINE DESCRIPTION`:
#   -   This field describes the entity (restaurant) cuisine.
# `ACTION`:
#   -   This field represents the actions that is associated with each restaurant inspection. ;
#   -   • Violations were cited in the following area(s).
#   -   • No violations were recorded at the time of this inspection.
#   -   • Establishment re-opened by DOHMH
#   -   • Establishment re-closed by DOHMH
#   -   • Establishment Closed by DOHMH.
#   -   • Violations were cited in the following area(s) and those requiring immediate action were addressed.
# `VIOLATION CODE`:
#   -   Violation code associated with an establishment (restaurant) inspection
# `VIOLATION DESCRIPTION`:
#   -   Violation description associated with an establishment (restaurant) inspection
# `CRITICAL FLAG`:
#   -   Indicator of critical violation;
#   -   • `Critical`
#   -   • `Not Critical`
#   -   • `Not Applicable`;
#   -   Critical violations are those most likely to contribute to food-borne illness
# `SCORE`:
#   -   Total score for a particular inspection;
# `GRADE`:
#   -   Grade associated with the inspection;
#   -   • `N` = Not Yet Graded
#   -   • `A` = Grade A
#   -   • `B` = Grade B
#   -   • `C` = Grade C
#   -   • `Z` = Grade Pending
#   -   • `P` = Grade Pending issued on re-opening following an initial inspection that resulted in a closure



# Q1a --------------------------------------------------------------
# What are the mean, standard deviation, first quartile, median, third quartile, 
# and maximum of `SCORE` for each `GRADE` of restaurants?


# Answer for Q1a

q1a_A<- restaurant %>%
  filter(GRADE=='A') 
skim(q1a_A$SCORE)

# mean:9.26, sd:3.42, Q1:7, med: 10, Q3:12, max:13

q1a_B<- restaurant %>%
  filter(GRADE=='B')
skim(q1a_B$SCORE)

# mean:21.0, sd:4.16, Q1:18, med:21, Q3:24, max:36

q1a_C<- restaurant %>%
  filter(GRADE=='C')
skim(q1a_C$SCORE)

# mean:38.6, sd:10.8, Q1:31, med:36, Q3:44, max:86

# No data with grade of Z,N, or P. 



# Q1b --------------------------------------------------------------
# How many restaurants with a `GRADE` of `A` are there in NYC?
# How much percentage of restaurants in NYC are a `GRADE` of `C`?

# Answer for Q1b

count(grade_a)
# 16305

(count(grade_c)/count(restaurant)) * 100
# 1.667 %



# Q1c --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe 
# how the distribution of `SCORE` varies by `GRADE` and `CRITICAL FLAG`.


# Answer for Q1c

ggplot(data=restaurant) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=SCORE), binwidth = 2)+
  facet_wrap(restaurant$'CRITICAL FLAG'~GRADE, scales= 'free_y')

# Critical A: The distribution ranges from roughly 0-12 and increases as it moves towards 15. It is left skewed.
# Critical B: The distribution ranges from roughly 12-25 and has a fairly even distribution. It is slightly left skewed.
# Critical C: The distribution ranges from roughly 0-40 and decreases. It is right skewed.
# Non Critical A: The distribution ranges from roughly 0-12 and increases as it moves towards 15. It is left skewed.
# Non Critical B: The distribution ranges from roughly 12-25 and has a fairly even distribution.
# Non Critical C: The distribution ranges from roughly 5-65 and decreases. It is right skewed.



# Q1d --------------------------------------------------------------
# Provide both (1) ggplot code and (2) a simple comment to describe 
# how the proportion of `CRITICAL FLAG` varies by `GRADE` and `BORO`.


# Answer for Q1d

ggplot(data=restaurant) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x= restaurant$'CRITICAL FLAG', y=after_stat(prop), 
                         group= 1, fill = BORO)) +
  facet_grid(BORO~GRADE)

# Grade A has a fairly even proportion between Critical and Non Critical 
# between all boroughs. Grade B and C has a less even distribution with Critical 
# having a higher proportion than Non Critical in all the boroughs. 



# Q1e --------------------------------------------------------------
# For the 10 most common `CUISINE DESCRIPTION` values, 
# find the `CUISINE DESCRIPTION` value 
# that has the highest proportion of `GRADE` `A`.

# Answer for Q1e

q1e<- restaurant %>%
  rename(cuisine='CUISINE DESCRIPTION') %>%
  group_by(cuisine)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
head(q1e, 10)

#American has the highest proportion of Grade A



# Q1f --------------------------------------------------------------
# Find the 3 most common names of restaurants (`DBA`) in each `BORO`.
# If the third most common `DBA` values are multiple, 
#   please include all the `DBA` values.
# Overall, which `DBA` value is most common in NYC?

# Answer for Q1f

q1f_Bronx<- restaurant %>%
  filter(BORO=='Bronx') %>%
  group_by(DBA)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
head(q1f_Bronx,3)

# dunkin, mcdonald's, kennedy fried chicken

q1f_Brooklyn<- restaurant %>%

  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
head(q1f_Manhattan,3)

# starbucks, dunkin, chipotle mexican grill

q1f_Queens<- restaurant %>%
  filter(BORO=='Queens') %>%
  group_by(DBA)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
head(q1f_Queens,3)

#dunkin, subway, dunkin and baskin robbins tied

q1f_Staten<- restaurant %>%
  filter(BORO=='Staten Island') %>%
  group_by(DBA)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
head(q1f_Staten,3)

# dunkin, subway, starbucks

q1f_NYC<- restaurant %>%
  group_by(DBA)%>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(-n)
head(q1f_NYC,1)

# dunkin is the most common



# Q1g --------------------------------------------------------------
# For all the `DBA` values that appear in the result of Q1f, 
# find the `DBA` value that is most likely to commit critical violation.

# Answer for Q1g

q1g<- restaurant %>%
  filter(q1f_Bronx== 'Critical')%>%
  group_by(DBA)%>%
  arrange(-SCORE)
head(q1g,1)

#cava grill
